# city-explorer-api

**Author** Chase Nickels

## Overview

City explorer is a static front end that will return the weather for a specific latitude and longitude based on user input.  This project is for us to build out an entire back end that will process that requet and, using API's return the requested information.

## Getting Started

In order to build this app, first you have to build the server from the ground up.  This includes your dependencies; .env, cors, express, and any others you might use.  And then, we were given a static front end to link into the project that will use the server we are building.  After that we will deploy to heroku and as we build the project out more we will link in API's to return valid information.

## Architecture

The front end for this app will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The back end uses heroku for deployment and has dependencies on express, cors, and dotenv.  It also uses nodemon to handle all of the packages required for the project and node.js for creating the environment for the server.
